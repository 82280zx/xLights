Notes to create the Nutcracker DLL project
Updated 26 Jan 2014, by Matt Brown

* The Visual Studio project is located in xLights\nccdll directory
* Requires MS Visual Studio 2010 or later
* Make sure the vc\bin directory is in your path (e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin)

-- First need to create 32b static libs  (debug/release)

* Create a fresh copy of the wxWidgets source (e.g. C:\wxWidgets-3.0.0vc) - do not reuse the wxWidgets directory compiled for xLights
* Open a command prompt
* cd to the fresh copy's build/msw subdirectory (e.g. C:\wxWidgets-3.0.0vc\build\msw)
* Run: vcvars32.bat
* Run: nmake -f makefile.vc SHARED=0 UNICODE=1 BUILD=debug
* Run: nmake -f makefile.vc SHARED=0 UNICODE=1 BUILD=release
* Close command prompt

-- Now build DLL using Visual Studio

* Open .sln file in xLights\nccdll directory using Visual Studio
* Right click on "nccdll" in Solution Explorer, select Properties from menu
* Click on VC++ Directories. Edit the Include and Library directories to match the wxWidgets location above.
* Set build type to Debug or Release, depending on your needs
* Build solution!
* DLL file will be in the Debug or Release subdirectory under nccdll.
