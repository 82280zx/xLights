        <h1>Random effects</h1>
        <p>xLights has a random effects feature that basically fills your sequence with exactly what the name suggests.</p>
        <p>To use it ... lay down some timing marks ... with a reasonable separation … say 5 seconds.</p>
        <p>Now click and drag to highlight a range of cells. You can select several models in this process and even several layers.</p>
        <p>Now right click and select generate random effects. Depending on how many cells you select the screen will flicker madly for a while and your grid will fill with a bunch of effects.</p>
        <p>While I wouldn’t sequence a song this way as you click around the newly created effects it is surprising how often you will see something that looks kind of cool which with a few tweaks you could include in a sequence. At that point time to find the presets tip of the day to learn how to save it so you can use it later.</p>
        <p>This is also a great way to stress test xlights ... nothing like 100 models, 3 minute song, 50ms timing marks select all cells generate random effects.</p>
